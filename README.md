# Drone_Dashboard
Drone Dashboard Project

Overview

The Drone Dashboard is a web-based interface designed to monitor and display real-time drone telemetry data. It provides a user-friendly UI to track parameters such as speed, altitude, and GPS coordinates. The project integrates a Python backend with a Flask web server and a front-end dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

Live Data Visualization: Displays real-time speed, altitude, and coordinates.

Interactive Map: Uses Leaflet.js for a dynamic, zoomable map with a crosshair indicating drone position.

Graphical Data Representation: Utilizes Chart.js/D3.js to visualize drone metrics over time.

Dark UI Theme: Improves visibility and aesthetics with a modern dark mode.

Flask-Powered Backend: Handles data updates and API communication.

Mock Data for Testing: Simulates drone telemetry for development and testing.

Technologies Used

Frontend:

HTML/CSS: For UI structure and styling.

JavaScript: For dynamic updates and interactivity.

Leaflet.js: To render an interactive map.

Chart.js/D3.js: For real-time graphing.

Backend:

Python (Flask): Manages API requests and data updates.

WebSockets/Flask-SocketIO: Enables real-time data transmission.

Mock Data Generator: Simulates drone telemetry for testing.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Flask (pip install flask)

Flask-SocketIO (pip install flask-socketio)

JavaScript libraries (included via CDN or package manager)

Installation Steps

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drone-dashboard.git
cd drone-dashboard

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Backend Server:

python app.py

Open the Frontend in a Browser:
Navigate to http://localhost:5000.

Usage

Start the Flask server to process drone telemetry.

Access the dashboard via a web browser.

Monitor live data, view drone position, and analyze metrics.

Future Enhancements

Integration with actual drone telemetry APIs.

Improved data persistence with a database.

Enhanced UI with more analytics and overlays.
